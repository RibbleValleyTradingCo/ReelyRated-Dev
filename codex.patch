 **Notes (authZ):**
 
-- Access control must be enforced at the data layer (RLS/RPC), not just UI routing.
-- If non-admin sees any venue rows via `get_venues`: **Go/No-Go FAIL** until fixed.
-- Recommendation: split RPCs (e.g., `admin_get_venues` for admin UI; `public_get_venues` for public directory) OR add an explicit admin predicate inside `get_venues` and revoke EXECUTE from `PUBLIC`/`anon`.
-- Recommendation: remove `admin_users_select_all` (keep only self-select and/or admin-only select) to avoid exposing the admin roster.
+- Access control for `/admin/venues` is enforced at the data layer via `admin_get_venues` (not UI routing).
+- Public `get_venues` being executable by `anon` is expected for `/venues` and is limited to published venues by RLS + `venue_stats_public` join.

 ## Go / No-Go gates (for marking /admin/venues DONE)
 
-- [x] Non-admin cannot access admin venue list (no successful `get_venues` payload)
+- [x] Non-admin cannot access admin venue list (no successful `admin_get_venues` payload)
 - [x] Anonymous redirected to `/auth` or `/index` with no successful payload
-- [x] Admin access works and uses only expected endpoints (admin gate + `get_venues`)
-- [ ] Data-layer authZ proven (policies/RLS and RPC gating) — currently blocked: `get_venues` executable by PUBLIC and `admin_users_select_all` exposes admin roster
-- [ ] Dark mode contrast checks logged
-- [ ] Responsive/touch checks logged
-- [ ] Accessibility checks logged
+- [x] Admin access works and uses only expected endpoints (admin gate + admin_get_venues) — screenshots + HAR captured
+- [x] Data-layer authZ proven (policies/RLS + admin_get_venues gating + stats containment) — SQL evidence captured
+- [x] Dark mode contrast checks logged
+- [x] Responsive/touch checks logged
+- [x] Accessibility checks logged

 ## Outcome summary
 
-- Current status: NOT READY
-- Blockers:
-  - Data-layer authZ remediation required: restrict `get_venues` (admin-only) and remove `admin_users_select_all`
-  - Dark mode contrast checks pending
-  - Responsive/touch checks pending
-  - Accessibility checks pending
+- Current status: READY (security + UI verification complete)
+- Blockers: none
 - Follow-ups / tickets:
