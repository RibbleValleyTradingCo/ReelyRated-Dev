# Public Rendering Rules

## Mapping
- Admin fields map directly to the venue detail page sections.

## Fallbacks
- Missing fields should show friendly empty states.
- No placeholder values like “N/A”.

## Visibility
- Draft/unpublished venues should be hidden from public listings.
- Admins and owners can preview drafts.

## Media
- Photos should render in the venue gallery; handle missing images gracefully.
