# Developer Workflow

This doc describes how to safely develop ReelyRated, especially around **Supabase migrations** and the **`main` branch**.

Audience: current you + any future collaborators.

## 1. Mental model

- **Git branches** = versions of the **codebase**.
  - `main` → production code.
  - `feature/*` → temporary branches for new work.
- **Supabase database** = the **data + schema**.
  - Right now we treat the **main Supabase DB** as the source of truth.
  - The old `phase-1` DB is considered historical and should not be used anymore.

The key idea:

> Code in `main` must always be compatible with the schema in the **main DB**.  
> We use **migrations** to evolve the DB in a controlled, additive way.

## 2. Branching model (Git)

**Default rule:**  
Do all work on short-lived feature branches, then merge to `main`.

Typical flow:

```bash
# Update local main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Start a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/short-description
