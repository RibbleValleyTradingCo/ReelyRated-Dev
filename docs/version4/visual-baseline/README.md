**Visual Baseline (v4)**  
Updated: 2025-12-17

Store before/after screenshots here (mobile + desktop) for key pages:
- Landing (`/`)
- Venues index/detail (`/venues`, `/venues/:slug`)
- Feed, Catch detail, Profile, Admin pages

Guidance:
- Capture both mobile (iPhone viewport) and desktop.
- Name files clearly (`page-device-date.png`).
- Use these baselines to verify visual consistency during v4 UI updates.
